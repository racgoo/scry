If you're using @racgoo/scry to perform tracing in a Node.js environment, the trace results will be saved in the scry folder at the root of your project.
You can view the results by opening the generated HTML file in your browser.
To see the latest tracing results, simply refresh the browser tab that has the file open.

For more details, please refer to `index.js`.
